&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:18
And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any marriage sermons usage of this verse is very prominent. This justifies the need for marriage. NIV goes a step ahead and increases the strength of this verse as below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:18(NIV)
The LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending time with people like Jesudian and listening a lot from Joseph Prince, Jonathan Welton etc one important habit I gained is reading verses in context possibly with larger context. As Pastor Prince usually say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;If you take the &amp;#39;text&amp;#39; out of &amp;#39;context&amp;#39; what you are left with is &amp;#39;con&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Joseph&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Prince&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It applies to translators too. Being NIV as a thought-by-thought translation it's an often target for further validations with context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 1 covers all the six days of creation by God and how He sees and creates things by His words. We can see the below passages where He found things to be &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:4
And God saw the light, that it was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:10
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:12
And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:18
And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:21
And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:25
And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:31
And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's going on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God is creating the whole earth step by step and in every step He is feeding himself with a self feedback. It is the usual way of man as well as God's creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Genesis 2 is the chapter where Creation of man, Plantation detains for Eden, Naming the animals &amp;amp; creation of woman have been recorded in detail. Apparently much of the Genesis 2 sits between Genesis 1:26 &amp;amp; Genesis 1:27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is the list of events took place chronologically, Watch the jumbled verse numbers in context&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:04 Creation of light&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:10 Creation of seas &amp;amp; ground&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:12 Creation of grass &amp;amp; herbs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:18 Creation of Sun, Moon &amp;amp; stars&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:21 Creation of fish &amp;amp; birds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:25 Creation of cattle &amp;amp; reptiles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:07 Creation of man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:08 Plantation of Eden&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:20 Naming the animals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:21 Creation of woman&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1:31 Over all review and certified to be good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2:02 God rests on seventh day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So keeping God's style of creation in mind when He said &lt;code&gt;It is not good that the man should be alone&lt;/code&gt; the right way to interpret it is &lt;code&gt;It doesn't look nice man being alone&lt;/code&gt;. This interpretation is ensured because once Eve is created God certified man, woman &amp;amp; everything looked nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here comes the killer. As usual NIV has proved it's out of context translation. Look what NIV tries to record&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genesis 2:18(NIV)
The LORD God said, "It is not good &lt;strong&gt;for the man&lt;/strong&gt; to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you see the difference? Here KJV stands right and final. The loneliness Adam had that day is no way related to today's unmarried people have. Adam's loneliness is something God was not interested because Earth needs to be populated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not coming to promote whether marriage is good or bad. The point I am bringing is the understanding that Genesis 2:18 has nothing to with marriage. It has different context and different meaning than we have normally understood and preached today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NIV's the phrase "It is not good &lt;strong&gt;for the man&lt;/strong&gt; to be alone" is not found in original text. Here is the interlinear passage I have attached&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-18.htm"&gt;http://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/2-18.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering this larger context I'm just smiling by remembering &lt;code&gt;1 Corinthians 7:1&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;Matthew 19:10&lt;/code&gt;.
